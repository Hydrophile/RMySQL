Installation:

   R CMD INSTALL [-l<alternate-dir>] RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz

S/W Requirements:

   MySQL client library ("libmysqlclient.so") and header files
   (see www.mysql.com).  For Linux/intel you may use the binary rpms 
   client+devel+shared, and make sure you also have the header files, 
   they are *NOT* included in the following
	MySQL-client-3.23.17-1.i386.rpm
	MySQL-shared-3.23.17-1.i386.rpm

   but they are included in the latest 3.23.33 rpm versions.

Potential configuration BUG  -- getopt.h and getopt.c

   If you're not using a GNU aware compiler (possibly on Sun, other 
   Unices and even cygwin?) you may need to use one or both of the 
   GNU files "getopt.c" and "getopt.h", which we include under the "gnu" 
   directory. (These two files come from the MySQL 3.22.27 source
   distribution.) This configuration bug will be fixed in the near future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
