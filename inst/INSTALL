Installation:

   R CMD INSTALL [-l<alternate-dir>] RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz

During installation, RMySQL looks for the MySQL headers and libraries
in the system directories.  If these are not installed in system-wide
directories (or if you want to use an alternate MySQL distribution),
you may specify which MySQL directory(ies) to use through one of the
following:

    1. The shell variables PKG_CPPFLAGS and PKG_LIBS (using Bourne shell)

       export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I<include-dir>"
       export PKG_CPPLIBS="-L<library-dir> -lmysqlclient"

or  2. Use the RMySQL configuration shell variables

           export MYSQL_INC=<include directory>"
           export MYSQL_LIB=<library directory>"

       You may also specify the base directory (this is the directory
       that has sub-directories "lib/mysql" and "include/mysql" directories)

           export MYSQL_DIR="<base directory>"

or 3. Use the --with-mysql-* RMySQL configuration arguments

          --with-mysql-dir=<base dir>
          --with-mysql-inc=<include dir>
          --with-mysql-lib=<library dir>

     e.g.,

          R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-mysql-dir=$HOME/mysql" ...

S/W Requirements:
-----------------

   MySQL client library ("libmysqlclient.so") and header files
   (see www.mysql.com).  For Linux/intel you may use the binary rpms 
   client+devel+shared, and make sure you also have the header files, 
   they are *NOT* included in the following
	MySQL-client-3.23.17-1.i386.rpm
	MySQL-shared-3.23.17-1.i386.rpm

   but they are included in the latest 3.23.33 rpm versions.

   The library libz.  This is a standard library on many (but not all)
   systems.  Under Red Hat, it's included in the rpm zlib-devel.
   I've been told that on debian it's in the zlib1g-dev package.

Potential configuration BUG  -- getopt.h and getopt.c

   If you're not using a GNU aware compiler (possibly on Sun, other 
   Unices and even cygwin?) you may need to use one or both of the 
   GNU files "getopt.c" and "getopt.h", which we include under the "gnu" 
   directory. (These two files come from the MySQL 3.22.27 source
   distribution.) This configuration bug will be fixed in the near future.
