Installation:

   R CMD INSTALL [-l<alternate-dir>] RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz

During installation, RMySQL looks for the MySQL headers and libraries
in the system directories.  If these are not installed in system-wide
directories (or if you want to use an alternate MySQL distribution),
you may specify which MySQL directory(ies) to use through one of the
following:

   1. The shell variables PKG_CPPFLAGS and PKG_LIBS (using Bourne shell)

       export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I<include-dir>"
       export PKG_LIBS="-L<library-dir> -lmysqlclient"

       For instance, on some 64 systems (e.g., Linux) you may need to set

       export PKG_CPPFALGS="-I/usr/include/mysql"
       export PKG_LIBS="-L/usr/lib64/mysql -lmysqlclient"

or  2. Use the RMySQL configuration shell variables

           export MYSQL_INC=<include directory>"
           export MYSQL_LIB=<library directory>"

       You may also specify the base directory (this is the directory
       that has sub-directories "lib/mysql" and "include/mysql" directories)

           export MYSQL_DIR="<base directory>"

or 3. Use the --with-mysql-* RMySQL configuration arguments

          --with-mysql-dir=<base dir>
          --with-mysql-inc=<include dir>
          --with-mysql-lib=<library dir>

     e.g.,

          R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-mysql-dir=$HOME/mysql" ...

S/W Requirements:
-----------------

   MySQL client library ("libmysqlclient.so") and header files
   (see www.mysql.com).  For Linux/intel you may use the binary rpms 
   client+devel+shared, and make sure you also have the header files, 
   they are *NOT* included in the following
	MySQL-client-4.1.7-1.i386.rpm
	MySQL-shared-4.1.7-1.i386.rpm

   but they are included in the latest 4.1.7 rpm versions.

   The library libz.  This is a standard library on many (but not all)
   systems.  Under Red Hat, it's included in the rpm zlib-devel.
   I've been told that on debian it's in the zlib1g-dev package.
