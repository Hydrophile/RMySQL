You need to have installed 'C Include Files / Lib Files' when
installing the MySQL binary distribution.

Then just set MYSQL_HOME to point to the top of the MySQL installation
and install via Rcmd INSTALL in the usual way.

To run tests in the tests directory, set MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_DATABASE, 
and MYSQL_PASSWD to appropriate values.
