The files getopt.c and getopt.h in this directory are part of the 
GNU libc, and they may be needed to compile RMySQL/SMySQL on non-GNU 
systems.  

If you use the GNU gcc compiler on non-GNU system (Solaris, Irix, 
Windows even with cygwin) you may still need the getopt.h header file.

These files were taken from the MySQL source distribution 3.22.27.
